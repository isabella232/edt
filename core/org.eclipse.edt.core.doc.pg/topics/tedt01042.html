<h2 class="title topictitle2">Use of the JTOpen Toolkit</h2>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">Direct access to IBM i host programs is by way of the JTOpen toolkit,
which determines what program types are supported. The toolkit is
not embedded in the software provided for EGL Development Tools. </p>

<div class="p">Here is the prerequisite task:<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Review the description at the following site and download the
toolkit:<ul class="sl simple">
<li class="sli"><a class="xref" href="http://jt400.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">JTOpen
(http://jt400.sourceforge.net/)</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="li">Extract the <span class="ph filepath">jt400.jar</span> file.</li>

<li class="li">Reference that file in the Java class path:<ol class="ol" type="a">
<li class="li">Right click the project that will access IBM i.</li>

<li class="li">Click <strong class="ph b">Properties</strong>. A properties dialog is displayed.</li>

<li class="li">Click <strong class="ph b">Java Build Path</strong>.</li>

<li class="li">In the pane at the right, click the Libraries tab.</li>

<li class="li">Click <strong class="ph b">Add External JARs</strong> and use the browse mechanism to
find the <span class="ph filepath">jt400.jar</span> file. </li>

<li class="li">Double click the file name and, at the properties dialog, click <strong class="ph b">OK</strong>.</li>

</ol>
</li>

</ol>
</div>

<p class="p">Later, you will add the jar file to the classpath of the server
that will receive your deployed application. For example, during EGL
deployment, you might add the file to the <span class="ph filepath">lib</span> folder
of the target project or as a library in the target EAR project. Outside
of EGL deployment, you might add the file as a resource in the server
classpath.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="overview">
<h2 class="title topictitle2">Development overview</h2>

<div class="body">
<div class="p">Your coding task has the following aspects:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You write an <em class="ph i">EGL proxy function</em>. In relation to IBM i,
the proxy function might be in any of the following types: an EGL
Library, Service, Program, or Handler. The function has no logic,
and any logic you place there will be ignored. Instead, you include
one or more annotations. <p class="p">As in service access, the main annotations
in the EGL proxy function are <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong>, which tells "where"
the backend code resides, and a second annotation that tells "what
more" is required by the EGL generator. The "what more" annotation
for IBM i is <strong class="ph b">IBMiProgram</strong>. </p>
<p class="p">One runtime effect of referencing
a resource binding is that you gain the performance benefits of using
a connection from the AS400 connection pool.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">When you write the EGL code that calls the function, you might
access the proxy function and rely on the details provided there.
Two variations apply:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">If you access the function remotely, you cannot override the <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong> annotation.
At this time, remote access is possible only from a Rich UI application.</li>

<li class="li">If access the function locally in generated Java code, you might
do as follows:<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Code a binding variable that references a different resource binding
or that specifies new detail.</li>

<li class="li">Refer to that variable in the <strong class="ph b">using</strong> clause of the <strong class="ph b">call</strong> statement. </li>

</ol>
<p class="p">When you include a <strong class="ph b">using</strong> clause, the coded detail overrides
the <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong> annotation. If the <strong class="ph b">using</strong> clause references
a different deployment-descriptor entry, you still gain the performance
benefits of using a pooled connection. However, the <strong class="ph b">using</strong> clause
might represent a connection that you define in your code; and in
that case, you typically do not use a pooled connection, but rely
on the AS400 connection object that is available in the JTOpen toolkit.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="li">The parameters of the EGL proxy function represent the parameters
of the host program, and your call can pass simple data, as well as
records and handlers. If a value is returned from the proxy function,
the type of value is an EGL Int. (On IBM i,
a return value is possible from a service program but not from a called
program.)</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">In general, a Rich UI application uses an asynchronous version
of the <strong class="ph b">call</strong> statement to get enterprise data from a service.
In relation to an IBM i program, the application calls a public proxy
function that is defined in an EGL Service type.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="runtimeprocess">
<h2 class="title topictitle2">Runtime process</h2>

<div class="body">
<div class="p">At run time, the proxy function is an endpoint for accessing an
IBM i program. That function acts as follows: <ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Retrieves a connection for the AS400 connection pool, if you are
using that kind of connection.</li>

<li class="li">Converts your data from an EGL format to byte arrays. The structure
of those arrays is based on a set of AS400DataType classes that are
provided by the JTOpen toolkit.</li>

<li class="li">Creates a JTOpen ProgramCall or ServiceProgramCall object, depending
on whether the call is to an IBM i
called program or service program.</li>

<li class="li">Creates JTOpen ProgramParameter objects and passes the byte arrays
to them.</li>

<li class="li">Calls the host program by calling the run method on the ProgramCall
or ServiceProgramCall object.</li>

<li class="li">Reformats the returned value (if any) to EGL format.</li>

<li class="li">Converts the returned byte arrays to EGL format. The structure
of those arrays is based on a set of AS400DataType classes that are
provided by the JTOpen toolkit.</li>

<li class="li">Returns the connection to the AS400 connection pool, if you are
using that kind of connection.</li>

</ol>

<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="developmentoverview">
<h2 class="title topictitle2">Coding details</h2>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">The objects expected by the host are based on fixed-size types,
whereas many EGL types are variably sized. You handle the difference
by annotating the variably sized objects. </p>

<p class="p">The annotations you specify are in the eglx.jtopen.annotations
package, with annotation type names that of the form Struct<em class="ph i">xxxx</em>.
The <em class="ph i">xxxx</em> part of an annotation type name correspond to a class
name in the JTOpen com.ibm.as400.access.AS400Datatype package. </p>

<p class="p">To determine which annotations to specify, refer to the table shown
later, along with the Javadoc for the com.ibm.as400.access.AS400Datatype
classes.</p>

</div>

<div class="topic nested2" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="proxyfunction">
<h3 class="title topictitle3">EGL proxy function for IBM i</h3>

<div class="body">
<div class="p">Here is an example of an EGL proxy function, including the annotations
named <strong class="ph b">ExternalName</strong> and <strong class="ph b">IBMiProgram</strong>:<pre class="pre codeblock">function GETRECA(CUST CUST[] inout, 
                 EOF   string inout, 
                 COUNT decimal (2,0) inout) 
   {
      @ExternalName{value="MyHostProc"},
      
      @Resource{uri = "binding:file:EGLDDFile#MyConnection"},
      
      @IBMiProgram {         
         programName = "GETREC",
         libraryName = "/QSYS.LIB/VARLABXX.LIB/",
         isServiceProgram=true,
         parameterAnnotations = [
            @AS400Array{elementCount = 10},
            @AS400Text{length = 1},
           	null 
         ]
      }
   }
end   </pre>
</div>

<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">ExternalName</strong> annotation is optional. It holds the name
of the IBM i procedure and defaults to the name of the EGL proxy function.</p>

<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong> annotation is optional. It provides a default
value; specifically, a reference to a binding that is defined in the
EGL deployment descriptor. See the earlier "Development overview"
section for details about the different implications of a local and
remote call. Also note that any value specified in the <strong class="ph b">library</strong> field
of the deployment descriptor entry replaces the <strong class="ph b">library</strong> field
in the <strong class="ph b">IBMiProgram </strong> annotation, which is the primary annotation
that structures the call.</p>

<div class="p">The <strong class="ph b">IBMiProgram</strong> is the primary annotation that structures
the call. The annotation holds the following detail:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The path of the library and program on IBM i. <p class="p">You can specify both details on the <strong class="ph b">programName</strong> field;
in the current example, the field value would be <samp class="ph codeph">"/QSYS.LIB/VARLABXX.LIB/GETREC"</samp>.
In any case, the EGL runtime code appends a file extension to the
value of the <strong class="ph b">programName</strong> field: .SRVPGM for service programs,
.PGM for called programs.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">A flag as to whether a service program is being invoked. </li>

<li class="li">Annotations for each parameter, as described later.</li>

</ul>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="topic nested2" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="datacon">
<h3 class="title topictitle3">Annotations for data conversion</h3>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">The data-conversion annotations cause the use of converters that
are found in the following JTOpen package: <samp class="ph codeph">com.ibm.as400.access</samp>.
The EGL annotation is similar to the Java class name: the annotation
name begins with "Struct" and ends with a substring such as "Bin4."
The use of the more general "Struct" substring in place of "AS400"
facilitates the future use of System z or other backend code. </p>

<div class="p">When you set a value for the <strong class="ph b">parameterAnnotations</strong> field,
you specify an annotation or the <strong class="ph b">null</strong> keyword for every annotation: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Values of simple reference types require an annotation. Example
types are String, Decimal, and Timestamp.</li>

<li class="li">Values of simple value types require an annotation only if you
do not want to accept the defaults. Example types are String(7), Decimal
(5,2), and Timestamp("yyyyMMddHHmm").</li>

<li class="li">Lists require a parameter annotation. </li>

<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">null</strong> is always used for a variable that is based on a Record
or Handler type.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">If you do not set a value for the <strong class="ph b">parameterAnnotations</strong> field,
the defaults are used for every parameter.</p>

<div class="p">Equivalent rules are in effect for the fields that are in a container;
that is, in a variable that is based on a Record or Handler type.
For example, here is a Record type with annotations:<pre class="pre codeblock">Record Example

   //Convert using the default StructBin4
   f1 int;

   //After the host program call, f2 is resized using the data returned in f3
   f2 int[]{@StructArray{elementCount = 10, returnCountVariable = f3}};

   //A fixed text with a length 2 characters using the default encoding
   f3 string{@StructText{length = 2}};

   //Convert a number to a StructDecFloat
   f4 number?{@StructDecFloat{length = 34}};

   //Convert using the default StructPackedDecimal
   f5 decimal(10,2);

   //Convert using the StructZonedDecimal
   f6 decimal(10,4){@StructZonedDecimal{}};
end</pre>
</div>

<p class="p">If that Record type included a record, you would not specify an
annotation for the included record, but might specify annotations
for the fields in that record.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="topic nested2" xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" id="callstatements">
<h3 class="title topictitle3">Call statements</h3>

<div class="body">
<p class="p">You write a <strong class="ph b">call</strong> statement to invoke the EGL proxy function.
A <strong class="ph b">using</strong> clause, if present, refers to a connection. If a <strong class="ph b">using</strong> clause
is not present in the <strong class="ph b">call</strong> statement or if the <strong class="ph b">call</strong> statement
is in a Rich UI application, the proxy function must reference a deployment
descriptor entry.</p>

<div class="p">Consider the following proxy function, which resides in an EGL
Program type: <pre class="pre codeblock">Program TestSimpleProgram

   //On IBM i, only service programs support a return
   function MyHostProcedure(p1 string, p2 string)RETURNS(INT)
   {
      @Resource{ uri = "binding:someEntry" },
      @IBMiProgram{
         programName = "/QSYS.LIB/VARLABXX.LIB/GETREC",
         isServiceProgram= true,
         parameterAnnotations = [@StructText{length = 10}, @StructText{length = 10}]
      }
   }
   end

   function main()
      
   end
end</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Here is a call from another function in the same program, including
reference to a Customer Record type. The call relies on the binding
detail that was just shown in the <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong> annotation:<pre class="pre codeblock">cust Customer;
result Int;
myString String = "abc";
try
   call MyHostProcedure(myString, cust) returns (result);
   onexception(exception AnyException)
	    //handle exception
end</pre>
</div>

<p class="p">Here is an alternative call, which provides binding detail that
overrides the binding detail, if any, that is specified in the proxy
function:</p>

<pre class="pre codeblock">cust Customer;
result int;
myString String = "abc";
conn IBMiConnection? = Resource.getResource("binding:someOtherConnection");
try
   call MyHostProcedure(myString, cust) 
      using conn
      returns (result);
   onexception(exception AnyException)
	     //handle exception
end</pre>

<div class="p">The following code is equivalent to the previous logic:<pre class="pre codeblock">cust Customer;
result int;
myString String = "abc";
try
   call MyHostProcedure(myString, cust) 
      using Resource.getResource("binding:someOtherConnection") 
         as IBMiConnection
      returns (result);
   onexception(exception AnyException)
	     //handle exception
end</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Here is yet another alternative call, which might provide a value
of type IBMiConnection instead of referencing the EGL deployment descriptor:<pre class="pre codeblock">cust Customer;
result int;
myString String = "abc";

conn IBMiConnection? = getMyDefinedConnection();
try
   call MyHostProcedure(myString, cust) 
      using conn
      returns (result);
   onexception(exception AnyException)
   //handle exception
end
</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">If you want to access the AS400 connection pool from your code,
you also assign connection detail to a variable of type IBMiConnection;
but for that purpose, you invoke the static Java function that is
referenced in the following EGL external type: <pre class="pre codeblock">externalType JTOpenConnections type JavaObject
   private constructor();
   static function getAS400ConnectionPool()returns(AS400ConnectionPool);
end</pre>
</div>

<p class="p">For details on that function, see the JTOpen documentation for
the AS400ConnectionPool object.</p>

<div class="p">Here is an explanation: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The StructArray annotation guides the conversion of the <samp class="ph codeph">f1</samp> field.
The list will include 10 elements at run time, and the StructText
annotation guides the conversion of the elements, which are of length
25. The f3 field contains the number of elements to accept when f1
is assigned the values that are returned from IBM i.</li>

<li class="li">The StructArray also guides the conversion of the <samp class="ph codeph">f2</samp> field.
