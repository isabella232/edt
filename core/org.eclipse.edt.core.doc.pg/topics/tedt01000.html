<h1 class="title topictitle1">Developing a service or program</h1>



<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">With EGL, you develop a service or program by coding a
Service or Program part, respectively. The basic structure is the
same. However, a service might provide several entry points, and programs
provide one.</p>

<p class="p">When you create a Service part, you specify whether it will be
deployed as a SOAP service, an EGL REST service, and EGL service,
or a subset of the three. You can change your decision later when
you work with the EGL deployment descriptor. Similarly, when you create
a Program part, you specify whether it will be deployed as a standard
Java application or as a JEE client application.</p>

<div class="p">Here is a Service part:<pre class="pre codeblock">Service MyServicePart
   value STRING = "Hello ";

   function myEcho(myString STRING IN) returns (STRING)
      return (value + myString);
   end
end</pre>
</div>

<p class="p">In this case, the logic accepts an input string, such as “world,”
and returns to the requester the concatenation of “Hello” and the
input string. </p>

<div class="p">A program or service can access services, programs, files, reports,
relational databases, and programs. In most cases, the following rules
apply:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Resources can be local to or remote from the platform where the
accessing logic runs.</li>

<li class="li">You specify the details for resource access by referencing an
entry in the deployment descriptor. The access detail is called a <dfn class="term">resource
binding</dfn>.</li>

</ul>
