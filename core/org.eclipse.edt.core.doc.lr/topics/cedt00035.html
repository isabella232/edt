<h1 class="topictitle1">Service classifier overview</h1>



<div><p>The capabilities of the Service classifier are made available
when you code a <dfn class="term">service</dfn>. The type is like a program that
has multiple entry points.</p>

<p>An EGL-generated service can be deployed as a REST service. The
logic in an EGL-written service is <dfn class="term">stateless</dfn>, which means
that the value of each variable is specific to the invocation.</p>

<p>Any EGL logic type can request a service. When you code the requester,
you declare a variable for service access, and that variable is based
on a type. If the service was written in EGL, you can use the Service
type as the type. Otherwise, you can only use an Interface type for
that purpose. </p>

<p>For further details on service invocation, see details on the Interface
classifier in “Classifiers for defining EGL prototype parts.”</p>

<div class="p">Here is an example of a service:<pre class="codeblock">Service MyService{}

   // variables and constants can be here

   function calculate(myScore INT[]) returns (BIN (4,2)) 

      numberOfScores, i, mySum INT;
      numberOfScores = myScore.getSize();
      	
      for (i from 1 to numberOfScores by 1)
         mySum = myScore[i] + mySum;	       
      end
    	      
      return(mySum/numberOfScores);
   end

   // other functions are here

end</pre>
</div>

<p>A Service type does not include a stereotype.</p>
