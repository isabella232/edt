<h1 class="topictitle1">Boxing and unboxing conversions</h1>



<div><p>Assignments to and from simple-type fields are straightforward
even if you mix reference and value types. For example, if you declare
a constant of a reference type such as STRING, the assigned value
is protected: </p>

<div class="p"><pre class="codeblock">const myString STRING = "Unchanging";
myString = "Error!";   // not valid    </pre>
</div>

<div class="p">A constant of a reference type other than a simple type <em>can</em> be
updated. For example, you can update the elements in a constant of
type INT[] because INT[] is a reference type, and only the reference
to the list is constant. However, the first of the following two rules
indicates the difference between a constant of type STRING and a constant
of type INT[]:<ul>
<li>When a simple-type reference field receives a value from a value
field or literal, a <dfn class="term">boxing conversion</dfn> occurs. The source
value is assigned to a new memory area, and the address of that area
is assigned to the reference field. The attempt to update a constant
of type STRING is not valid because the constant cannot reference
a different memory area.</li>

<li>When a simple-type value field receives a value from a reference
field, an <dfn class="term">unboxing conversion</dfn> occurs. The value field
receives the business value to which the reference field refers.</li>

</ul>
